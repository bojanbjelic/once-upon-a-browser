#Once upon a browser
JavaScript snippet to randomly rotate elements on the page.

Based on the idea presented in the article [Spinning the Web](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2011/06/03/spinning-the-web/) by Eric Meyer.

Here is Eric's [Flickr set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/meyerweb/sets/72157626750845115/with/5793617592/), and [here's mine](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bojanbjelic/sets/72157630173696042/).

If you would like to take the bookmarklet, you can pick it up from [my blog](http://www.bjelic.net/2012/06/25/coding/once-upon-a-browser/) since it's not possible to use javascript code in GitHub pages.
